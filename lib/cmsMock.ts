      "SpaceX reports Q2 earnings on Aug. 4, but a rich valuation means even a strong report may not reverse the stock's 45% slide from its peak.",

      "Space Exploration Technologies went public on June 12 and quickly surged to $225.64 before falling 45%, leaving even IPO investors who bought at the $135 offering price underwater. The company reports second-quarter results on Aug. 4, alongside a call led by CEO Elon Musk.",
      "A good quarter may not be enough to spark a recovery. SpaceX trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 83.7, dramatically above the Nasdaq-100's 6.2 — a steep premium relative to its large-cap technology peers.",
      "Analysts expect roughly $6.87 billion in second-quarter revenue. Starlink connectivity led the first quarter with $3.26 billion from 10.3 million subscribers, and the AI infrastructure unit, aided by deals with Anthropic and Google, likely grew substantially.",

      "Buzz is building that Meta will unveil a cloud computing business alongside its July 29 earnings — and Alphabet's blowout cloud results make the case.",

      "Speculation is building that Meta Platforms will announce a new cloud computing business when it reports second-quarter earnings on July 29. The company hasn't confirmed it, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said a cloud business is 'definitely on the table.'",
      "Recent reporting adds fuel: Bloomberg says Meta is building out cloud infrastructure, and The New York Times says it is in talks to lease computing power to Anthropic in a deal potentially worth $10 billion over two years. Meta has guided to $125 billion to $145 billion in capex this year, much of it for AI.",
      "Meta is the only one of the four major hyperscalers — alongside Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon — without its own cloud business. Demand is soaring: Alphabet just reported 82% revenue growth to $24.8 billion in Google Cloud, with operating income more than tripling to $8.8 billion.",

      "Among young electric-vehicle makers, Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive have separated themselves from smaller players. But China-based Nio often flies under the radar despite recently crushing both on one crucial measure: gross profitability.",
      "Young EV automakers face expensive battery technology, unprofitable early-stage scaling, and volatility from policy shifts, shrinking tax incentives, and tariffs. Consistent gross profit is the clearest early sign a company can scale toward long-term viability.",
      "Rivian has made real progress on gross margin since 2023 — aided by cost cuts and a Volkswagen joint venture bringing non-dilutive capital and higher-margin software licensing — while Lucid has lagged. Nio, with far greater scale, has pulled ahead of both.",
